# Is it infected?

This repo reflects my efforts of building a reddit bot that will detect pictures of infected homebrew using deep learning.

Current status:

* ~write a script that scrapes the [r/Homebrewing](http://reddit.com/r/Homebrewing) subreddit for pictures of infected homebrew~
* retraining TensorFlow Hub model trained on ImageNet to classify homebrew pictures
* write a script that can classify an image based on the retrained model
* write a reddit bot that does the above step automatically
* improve reddit bot that users can provide feedback that influences the model
